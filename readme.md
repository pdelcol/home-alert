# Home Alert System
#### Replacement program for Bryx-Home
##Reasoning
* Get new data from the 911 feed
* Want to implement the ability to control the program so that you can set yourself in/out of service
* No need to use selenium
* Easier to create a docker container with npm than it is to install each package manually
